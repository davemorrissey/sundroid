Sundroid Privacy Policy
=======================

This is the privacy policy for [Sundroid's listing in the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=uk.co.sundroid.free).

Sundroid is a free and open source app. You can browse the source [on GitHub](https://github.com/davemorrissey/sundroid).

Sundroid does not include any adverts, tracking code, or analytics libraries. It does not send any
information of any kind to the developer or any third party.

Google and your phone manufacturer may collect information about your use of the app for their own
purposes; what they collect and what they do with this information is not under the developer's
control. Further information may be found in their privacy policies.

Location Permissions
--------------------

Sundroid can be used without granting location permission if you wish. You will need to grant location
permission when using the "My Location" option. For technical reasons, this permission is also required
to determine location names and time zones when using the map feature. Location search requires no
permissions.

Widgets require permission to access your location while the app is not running, if you choose the
auto location option. Your location will be updated every 6 hours and only used to update your widgets.
You can use a saved location for widgets if you prefer.
